# PHP 8.1.x no longer receives bug fixes unless they address security
# issues. That means no build fixes, no updates for modern compilers,
# and no tweaks for newer versions of dependencies. We can't really
# afford to maintain our own little fork of this, so it's time to
# upgrade (sorry). With it goes any unmaintained PECL packages
# that don't support 8.2 or newer.
