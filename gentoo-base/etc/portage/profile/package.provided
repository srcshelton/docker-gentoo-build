# We can't compile glibc during docker's 'build' phase, so we have to exclude
# it (and its virtuals) here.  However, we need to specify packages by
# specific version, and so the actual version to exclude will be auto-generated
# from the Dockerfile.

# The above is no longer the case, as all package build steps are now executed
