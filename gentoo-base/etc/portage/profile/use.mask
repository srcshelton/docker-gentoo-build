# Enable all LLVM targets unconditionally.  Unfortunately, disabling
# targets tend to break reverse dependencies (e.g. Rust) and we are yet
# to find a clean way of resolving that.  Compared to the damage
# potential, the increase of build time is a minor problem.  Users who
# really insist of building a smaller system can un-force the flags
# at their own responsibility. See bug #767700.
